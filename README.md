# FindExtend
FindExtend is a chrome extension that searches links on a page for a search term the user enters, and returns the number of occurances, if
any, in any of those links. 

To get the current working version of the extension, one must enable developer mode in chrome, and load the extension in unpacked. We are
currently working towards making the extension avaliable in the chrome web store
